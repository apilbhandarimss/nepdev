            <h1>Python for CS student Why, How, When,What?</h1><br>
          <h2>What  is Python ?</h2>
          <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>
            <h2>Why Python?</h2>
    <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.See Side by side comparision of python and other laungauge <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/">Click here</a> </p>
    <h2>When to learn Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is amazing laungauge, mostly used in the feild of Datascience, Python is time saver even so memed as the slow language whis is true when implementing code but that slowness is nothing compared to the efficency while you Write code, Its easyness makes it a good choice to learn programming since it is powerful enough while being easy so u don't have to sift laungauge, So if are looking to be more advance in the feild of cs or you are just starting learnin python is brilliant choice, it is also brilliant when you already know a laungauge but want to shift for more efficiency and 'Money' also it is also a good choice for Webdev, Gamedev, ML and also Datascience, Its all in one so mind it,</p>
    <h2>How to learn Python?</h2>
          
              <p> This is very no most easy question ever there are many ways to learn python but I suggest Use either Coursera or Sololearn for the basics, and learn and do projects seeing youtube then if you are in datascience then learn from Datacamp, more details below</p>
                <h2>Sololearn</h2>
                <p>Remember this site my boys, This is all in one for learning How to code? you can litearlly learn anything from here I mean all laungauge, I personally learnt C#,Js from Sololearn and This is amazing go to Sololearn.com and start your coding journey in python</p>
                <h2>Coursera</h2>
                <p>Coursera is the best place to get online courses, but you have to struggle little bit here, all (most of the courses) are pain however you can learn them for free trough finincial aid, I sugest Coursera's Course Python for everyone, this is basic yet prouctive course you can learn more about courses in Coursera</p>
                <h2>Youtube</h2>
                <p>Youtube is the best place to learn anything, you can learn python from youtube, there are many channels that teach python,yes you don't get certificate from there but I suggest learning form youtube more but do get basic certificates from Coursera or Sololearn, but learn most of it from youtube cause it is free and awesome </p>
                <h2>Datacamp</h2>
                <p>This option is problably new for many o f you since this isn't much popular mainly cause it isn't free, but that doesn't mean you are paying for it not under my watch you can get free trial from github  edu account  I suggest using this mainly for Datascience and this is what I used to learn Python</p>
